# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces virtual fields functionality to ApiForge, allowing developers to define computed fields that don't exist in the database but can be filtered, selected, and sorted. Virtual fields are calculated on-demand using custom callback functions, enabling powerful API capabilities like calculated totals, formatted dates, concatenated names, and complex business logic computations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an API developer, I want to define virtual fields with custom calculation logic, so that I can expose computed values without storing them in the database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure a virtual field with a callback function THEN the system SHALL register the field as available for filtering and selection
2. WHEN I define a virtual field with dependencies THEN the system SHALL automatically include required database fields in queries
3. WHEN I specify a virtual field type and operators THEN the system SHALL validate and apply filters using the computed values
4. IF a virtual field callback throws an exception THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully and log the error
5. WHEN I configure caching for virtual fields THEN the system SHALL cache computed values to improve performance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to filter and sort by virtual fields using the same syntax as regular fields, so that I can query computed data seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I apply a filter to a virtual field THEN the system SHALL compute the field value and apply the filter condition
2. WHEN I sort by a virtual field THEN the system SHALL order results based on the computed values
3. WHEN I select virtual fields in the fields parameter THEN the system SHALL include the computed values in the response
4. WHEN I use operators like 'like', 'gte', 'in' on virtual fields THEN the system SHALL apply them to the computed values
5. IF a virtual field computation fails for a record THEN the system SHALL exclude that record from filtered results or use a default value

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an API developer, I want to define virtual fields that depend on relationships, so that I can create computed fields using related model data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I define a virtual field that uses relationship data THEN the system SHALL automatically eager load the required relationships
2. WHEN I configure relationship dependencies THEN the system SHALL validate that the relationships exist on the model
3. WHEN I filter by a virtual field with relationship dependencies THEN the system SHALL join or subquery as needed for performance
4. IF a required relationship is missing THEN the system SHALL return null or a configured default value
5. WHEN I use nested relationship data in virtual fields THEN the system SHALL handle deep relationship loading efficiently

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an API developer, I want to configure virtual field performance settings, so that I can optimize API response times for computed fields.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enable caching for virtual fields THEN the system SHALL cache computed values with configurable TTL
2. WHEN I configure batch processing for virtual fields THEN the system SHALL compute multiple records efficiently
3. WHEN I set memory limits for virtual field processing THEN the system SHALL respect the limits and handle overflow gracefully
4. IF virtual field computation exceeds time limits THEN the system SHALL timeout gracefully and return partial results
5. WHEN I enable lazy loading for virtual fields THEN the system SHALL only compute fields that are actually requested

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an API developer, I want to validate virtual field configurations at startup, so that I can catch configuration errors early in development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate all virtual field configurations
2. WHEN I define a virtual field with invalid dependencies THEN the system SHALL throw a configuration exception
3. WHEN I specify unsupported operators for a virtual field type THEN the system SHALL warn or throw an exception
4. IF a virtual field callback is not callable THEN the system SHALL throw a configuration exception
5. WHEN I configure conflicting virtual field names THEN the system SHALL detect and report the conflict

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want virtual fields to work with existing ApiForge features, so that I can use them with pagination, field selection, and complex filtering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I paginate results with virtual field filters THEN the system SHALL apply filters before pagination
2. WHEN I combine virtual field filters with regular field filters THEN the system SHALL apply both filter types correctly
3. WHEN I use virtual fields in complex filter expressions THEN the system SHALL support AND/OR logic combinations
4. WHEN I select only virtual fields THEN the system SHALL still load required dependencies efficiently
5. IF I use virtual fields with relationship filters THEN the system SHALL coordinate both filter types properly
